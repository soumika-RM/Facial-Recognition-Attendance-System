# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System

Hey there! Welcome to the Facial Recognition Attendance System project. This project allows you to take attendance using your computer's camera and recognize people's faces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/soumika-RM/Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
    ```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

    ```bash
    cd Facial-recognition-Attendance-System
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Place images of people you want to recognise in the `images` folder. Make sure to name the images with the person's name (e.g., `ironman.jpeg`).

2. Run the program.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The camera will open, and if a recognised person is detected, their name will be displayed on the screen. The attendance details will be saved in a CSV file for your record.

4. Press 'q' to exit the program.

## Customize

Feel free to add more faces by placing additional images in the `images` folder.

## Troubleshooting

- If the program doesn't recognise faces properly, try adjusting the lighting or experiment with different face images.

- Make sure to have fun experimenting with the project! If you face any issues, reach out to the community or the project owner.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
